# Dynmap Nametags
This mod lets you view players thousands of blocks away in game using dynmap. This mod was made solely for personal use
on a dedicated minecraft server, using this mod on a different server would require modification.

This mod was not made with future modification or revision in mind and therefore the code is quite messy.
